# Fortnite Aim Assist

This program provides a simple aim assist for Fortnite using computer vision techniques. It tracks the second furthest player on screen and moves the mouse to their head position. The program has adjustable parameters and can be toggled on and off using function keys.

**Note**: The use of AI-assisted aiming in online games may be against the terms of service, and you should be aware of the consequences of using such programs.
